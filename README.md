# Client.

```bash
cd ./client && npm install
npm run dev
```
The client server will start and you will see the download button in the local server. From there you can download the file from your server.

# Server
```bash
cd ./server && npm install
npm run start
```

In the node server you can iterate yourself and choose the file you want your client to download.
